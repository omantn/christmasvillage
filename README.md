This is the source for my Raspberry pi powered christmas village.

Some pieces I used in the construction apart from the obvious.

I used these great UL certified jumpers to share ground or power pins and for easy cross connect

Here is the module I used to power the train, if you look in the repo it uses PWM to adjust speed.

Here are the proximity sensors I will be using, you can see in the code I wire them up, but they are currently unused, plan to have them detect where the train is at on the track so the "stop at station" button works.
